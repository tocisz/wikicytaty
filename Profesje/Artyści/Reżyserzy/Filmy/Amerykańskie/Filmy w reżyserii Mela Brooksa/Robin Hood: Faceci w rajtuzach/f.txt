Postać: Faceci w rajtuzach

We’re men, we’re men in tights
We roam around the forest looking for fights
We’re men, We’re men in tights
We rob from the rich and give to the poor, that’s right!
We may look like sissies
But watch what you say, or else we’ll put out your lights!
We’re men, we’re men in tights
Always on guard defending the people’s rights

La, la, la, … etc.

We’re men, manly men, we’re men in tights. Yeah!
We roam around the forest looking for fights
We’re men, we’re men in tights
We rob from the rich and give to the poor, that’s right!
We may look like pansies
But don’t get us wrong, or else we’ll put out your lights!
We’re men, we’re men in tights, tight tights
Always on guard defending the people’s rights
When you’re in a fix, call for the men in tights!
We’re Butch! (ang.)
